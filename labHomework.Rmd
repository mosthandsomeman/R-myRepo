## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


#Part I
```{r}
exp.draws.1 <- rexp(n = 200, rate = 1)
exp.draws.1.mean <- mean(exp.draws.1)
exp.draws.1.sd <- sd(exp.draws.1, na.rm = FALSE)
exp.draws.1.var <- var(exp.draws.1, na.rm = FALSE)


exp.draws.0.1 <- rexp(n = 200, rate =0.1)
exp.draws.0.5 <- rexp(n = 200, rate = 0.5)
exp.draws.5 <- rexp(n = 200, rate = 5)
exp.draws.10 <- rexp(n = 200, rate = 10)


hist(exp.draws.1)

plot(exp.draws.1)
plot(sort(exp.draws.1))
plot(exp.draws.5)
plot(exp.draws.10)
plot(exp.draws.0.1)
plot(exp.draws.0.5)
plot(exp.draws.1, exp.draws.10)
```

```{r}
exp.draws.mean <- c(mean(exp.draws.1), mean(exp.draws.0.1), mean(exp.draws.0.5), mean(exp.draws.5),mean(exp.draws.10))

exp.drwas.rate <- c(1, 0.1, 0.5, 5, 10)
exp.drwas.deviations <- c(sd(exp.draws.1), sd(exp.draws.0.1), sd(exp.draws.0.5), sd(exp.draws.5),sd(exp.draws.10))
```

```{r}
plot(exp.draws.mean, exp.drwas.rate)

plot(exp.drwas.deviations, exp.drwas.rate)

plot(exp.draws.mean, exp.drwas.deviations)
```


#Part II
```{r}
big.exp.draws.1 <-rexp(n = 1100000, rate = 1)

big.exp.draws.1.mean <- mean(big.exp.draws.1)

big.exp.draws.1.var <- sd(big.exp.draws.1)

plot(big.exp.draws.1)
```

```{r}
big.exp.draws.bigThan1 <- big.exp.draws.1[big.exp.draws.1 > 1]


big.exp.draws.1.mat <- matrix(big.exp.draws.bigThan1, nrow = 1100)

big.exp.draws.1.hist <- hist(big.exp.draws.1.mat)
```


```{r}
#mean(big.exp.draws.1.mat[, 371])
big.exp.draws.1.mat.colMean <- colMeans(big.exp.draws.1.mat)

hist(big.exp.draws.1.mat.colMean)

```

```{r}

big.exp.draws.1.sq <- big.exp.draws.1 * big.exp.draws.1

big.exp.draws.1.sq.mean = mean(big.exp.draws.1.sq)
big.exp.draws.1.sq.var = sd(big.exp.draws.1.sq)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
